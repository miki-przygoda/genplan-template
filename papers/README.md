#### This repository includes a written summary of the system developed as part of my COMP1827 coursework at the University of Greenwich:
- COMP1827 Report (Coursework Version):
`papers/Mikolaj_Mikuliszyn_COMP1827-Report.pdf`

#### This document provides a concise, ~1500-word overview of the evolutionary algorithm, the RL-guided seeding mechanism, and the 500-run comparative evaluation conducted in this project.

##### A full academic paper expanding on this work—including deeper ablations, broader related work, and extended experimental analysis—is currently in preparation and will be added to this repository upon completion.
